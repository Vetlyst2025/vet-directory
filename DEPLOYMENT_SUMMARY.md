## 🚀 Next Steps: Deploy to Vercel + Custom Domain

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `madison-vet-finder`
3. Keep it **Private** (recommended)
4. **DO NOT** check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub (1 minute)

Copy these commands and replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:

```bash
cd /home/code/vet-directory
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/madison-vet-finder.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (3 minutes)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/signup
2. Sign up/login with your **GitHub account** (easiest)
3. Click **"Add New Project"**
4. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
5. Select `madison-vet-finder`
6. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js ✅

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

Before clicking "Deploy", add these 3 environment variables:

**Click "Environment Variables" and add:**

```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
Value: [Your Supabase URL from project settings]

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: [Your Supabase anon key from project settings]

Name: RESEND_API_KEY
Value: [Your Resend API key from dashboard]
```

**Where to find these:**
- Supabase: Project Settings → API → URL & anon key
- Resend: Dashboard → API Keys

### Step 5: Deploy!

Click **"Deploy"** and wait 2-3 minutes ⏱️

Your site will be live at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Step 6: Connect Custom Domain (madisonvetfinder.com)

1. In Vercel, go to your project → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Enter: `madisonvetfinder.com`
3. Vercel will show you DNS records to add

**Go to your domain registrar and add these DNS records:**

**For root domain (madisonvetfinder.com):**
- Type: `A`
- Name: `@` (or leave blank)
- Value: `76.76.21.21`

**For www subdomain:**
- Type: `CNAME`
- Name: `www`
- Value: `cname.vercel-dns.com`

**DNS propagation takes 5-30 minutes** (sometimes up to 48 hours)

Vercel will automatically provision SSL certificate 🔒
